# DoublePendulumRK4
## Double Pendulum Simulation
This project simulates the motion of a double pendulum using accurate physical equations and Runge-Kutta 4th-order (RK4) integration. The simulation is visualized using `pygame`, providing an interactive and intuitive way to explore the chaotic nature of the double pendulum system.

## Features
- **Physics-based simulation:** The motion of the pendulum is accurately modeled based on the equations of motion for a double pendulum without damping.
- **RK4 Integration:** The system's equations are integrated using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method for higher accuracy.
- **Realistic visualization:** The pendulums are drawn on a Pygame window with realistic motion, showing the chaotic behavior of the system.
- **Adjustable parameters:** You can modify the lengths, masses, and initial angles of the pendulums to observe different behaviors.
